    "Preheat the oven to 325Â°F with a rack in the center. Lightly grease two 8\" or 9\" round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment and grease the parchment. If your 8\" pans aren't at least 2\" deep, use 9\" pans.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, either using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with whisk attachment, beat the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract (if using), until thickened and light gold in color, about 2 minutes at medium-high speed.",
    "Add the dry ingredients and mix just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly.",
    "In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the milk just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the butter and oil, stirring until the butter has melted.",
    "Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth.",
    "Divide the batter evenly between the pans.",
    "Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean and the top feels set (see below for baking times).",
    "Remove from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow to cool for 15 minutes in the pans. Transfer them to a rack, right-side up, to cool to room temperature."
